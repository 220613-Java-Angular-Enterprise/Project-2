# Communication is the Key to Success


## Suggestions:
- Use a [Kanban Board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) like [Trello](https://trello.com/?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=105703214328&campaign=9843285532&creative=437184392320&device=c&keyword=trello&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p53016490704&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001557344&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2af-BRDzARIsAIVQUOfgZifIwr-ClvNLXs4m9zn7VFhTU4bXoVdq1iBVe7SNfiXGeVVNKlgaAsHAEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
